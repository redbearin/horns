User Story
copied from the lab md
### Feature #1: Display images

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user naviates to the home page  
Then the photo gallery should display all of the images in the gallery  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Use AJAX, specifically `$.get()`, to read the provided JSON file.
- Each object should become a new instance of a constructor function. Refer to the data to determine the necessary properties.
- Use jQuery to make a copy of the HTML template of the photo component. For each object, fill in the duplicated template with its properties, then append the copy to the DOM.

### Feature #2: Filter images

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user clicks on the dropdown menu  
When the user selects one of the options  
Then only the images whose keyword matches the option should be displayed  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Create a `<select>` element which contains unique `<option>` elements extracted dynamically from the JSON file, one for each keyword.
- Use an event handler to respond when the user chooses an option from the select menu. Hide all of the images, then show those whose keyword matches the option chosen.

### Feature #3: Style the application

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a gridlike pattern.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the images should be displayed in rows across the screen  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Style your application using floats.
- Utilize at least one Google font.
